What new skills have you learned?
As far as the lessons go, I didn’t learn too much yet. I never used superscript tag before but I have been studying hardcore for the past 9 months so I knew a good amount of what was reviewed. What was helpful was joining the community and using Slack for the first time. I also had to work with CodePen again and figure out how to create a pen and how to post my project.

What has been easy?
The lessons have been pretty easy thus far but I am sure they will get harder since I am only on Lesson 4.

What has been difficult?
Trying to find time to go through the lessons and keep up with all the posts on Slack and the forum. Trying to figure out a good balance between the two but I find myself on Slack a lot talking to fellow coders which I am loving.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
The first few lessons pushed us to research stuff that wasn't necessary taught which is an important thing to learn as a front end developer.
